This is a simple python script that uses FFMPEG to splice together Go Pro splits into one

Moving Go Pro files over to a machine are already a hassle as the Go Pro will split the videos into smaller chunks requiring the user to splice them together with a video editor of sorts.
Using FFMPEG is a quicker way of splicing these splits together but still a bit of set up. This Python script is just expiting the process. The end videos will still need to be renamed.
